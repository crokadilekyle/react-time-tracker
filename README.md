# react-time-tracker
Created with CodeSandbox

A simple time tracker built with react that saves timestamps and calculates the duration between time stamps.  Useful for keeping track of how long you spent working on something.

This is a copy of my [Time Tracker](https://github.com/crokadilekyle/timetracker) but that one was built with Vanilla JS, while this one is built using React.
